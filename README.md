File Name Text Remover
This Python script is designed to interactively remove specified text from file names in a selected folder. It incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Tkinter (included in standard Python libraries)
Script Overview:
Importing Modules:

The script begins by importing the necessary modules:
os: Provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality, used here for file and directory operations.
tkinter: A standard GUI toolkit for Python.
filedialog and simpledialog from tkinter: Used for creating file dialog boxes and obtaining user input.
Function Definitions:

rename_files(folder_path, text_to_remove): This function takes the folder path and text to remove as parameters. It iterates through each file in the specified folder, and if the specified text is found in the file name, it removes the text and renames the file. Any errors encountered during this process are caught and displayed.
Main Function (main()):

Creates the main window for the GUI but immediately hides it using root.withdraw() to avoid unnecessary visibility.
Invokes a file dialog using filedialog.askdirectory to allow the user to select a folder. If the user cancels the selection, the script exits gracefully.
Asks the user to input the text they want to remove from the file names using simpledialog.askstring.
If the user cancels this input, the script exits.
Requests confirmation from the user before proceeding with the changes. If the user confirms, the rename_files function is called; otherwise, the script terminates.
Execution (__main__ block):

Calls the main() function when the script is run.
How to Use:
Run the script using Python (python script_name.py).
A window will appear, prompting you to select a folder using the file dialog.
Enter the text you want to remove from the file names when prompted.
Confirm that you want to proceed with the changes.
The script will process the files in the selected folder, removing the specified text from their names.
Upon completion, a message will be displayed indicating the success or any encountered errors.
Note:
It's recommended to test the script on a backup or sample directory before using it on important data.
The script provides a simple and interactive way to batch process file names within a specified folder, making it user-friendly for individuals with minimal programming experience.
